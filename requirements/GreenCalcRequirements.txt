Green Calc

In a Galaxy far, far away on a planet called Sam lives a species called Sung that is very
different from humans. They only have 3 fingers instead of 5. As a result, they use different
numerical system than inhabitants of planet Earth. Sungs only recognize shades of green
and are very keen on seeing your solution for a base 6 calculator implemented using React
Native technology.

Provide the source code for the complete solution that can be compiled and tested.
